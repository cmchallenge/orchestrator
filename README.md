# Orchestrator

ClearMetal runs on a distributed services architecture.  This architecture has various components that need to be synchronized to complete our daily pipeline.  

In order to run this pipeline, we need an orchestrator that can schedule and synchronize tasks to be run.  

Your job is to create this orchestrator.  The two guidelines for the orchestrator are:
- A task can be either recurring or one-time
- A task can have dependencies.  For example, TaskABC may need to be executed before TaskXYZ can start

You can code this challenge in the language of your choice, and you can design the tasks however you want (i.e. they can be a bash script, a python script, etcâ€¦).   

This is designed to be a fairly open-ended challenge, which means there are a lot of directions you can take it (distributed task processing, complex dependency checking, graceful failures, retries, etc.).  We ask that you not spend too much time on it as we are mostly evaluating your thought process and your code design rather than a fully working framework.
